Traveller Physics
* Angle the traveller is at when climbing/falling/steady

UIs
* Traveller needs an actual body
* Obstacles need deco
* Main menu is horrific


Long term features
* Save high score locally

Bugs (or potential bugs)
* Obstacle position is not yet exact. Hitting what I think is max y of screen height is actually beyond that, so they aren't full size, I don't think
* Get rid of all force unwrapping and have defaults, by known iPhone 11 or 12 screen sizes as a base. Or detect phone? Idk

Test
* Test sizes, renders, methods, collisions

Gameplay
* We want two obstacles more often than 1/3 of the time. Currently its random, 1/3 top, 1/3 bottom 1/3 both
    ** Really want it more 1/6 top, 2/6 bottom, 4/6 both. Or 1/5, 2/5, 3/5
    ** Either adjust enum for more values, or get randomInt from 5 or 6 choices, and cases 1, cases 2-3.. etc
