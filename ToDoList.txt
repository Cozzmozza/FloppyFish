UIs
* Traveller
    -   Fish needs some animation for swimming, 2d swimming
    -   When dead, eyes go like X
* Obstacles decoration
* Own background
* Main menu prettyness
    ** Background
    ** Buttons
    ** Font, logos
    ** Button press animations
* Count down animation
* How to play animation on the main menu
* Pause button logo
* Countdown going big to small, like THREEeee, TWWOOoo, OOOOnnee...
* Move buttons to sensible places to prevent accidental touch
* Some bubbles from the fish maybe?

Gameplay
* When pause is pressed, a big play button appears on screen
* Move high score to some parent or handler struct so game menu can access it

Test
* Test sizes, renders, methods, collisions

UI Requiring Gameplay changes
* Border at the top for buttons? All tube y positions will have to change by border height.. like deletgate.childNode(withName: topBorder).size.height
* (Maybe) Separate background and ground. Ground becomes obstacle. Results in more physics, but might help with different screen sizes (guessing!), and better U

Performance
* Countdown is only needed for first 3 seconds, how can we disable this. Ideally find a way to also be able to run a countdown after pausing
