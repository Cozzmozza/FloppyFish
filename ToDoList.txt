Traveller Physics

UIs
* Traveller needs an actual body
* Obstacles decoration
* Own background
* Main menu prettyness
    ** Background
    ** Buttons
    ** Font, logos
    ** Button press animations
* Count down animation
* How to animation on the main menu
* Pause button logo
* Countdown going big to small, like THREEeee, TWWOOoo, OOOOnnee...

Long term features
* Save high score locally upon app closure

Test
* Test sizes, renders, methods, collisions

UI Requiring Gameplay changes
* Border at the top for buttons? All tube y positions will have to change by border height.. like deletgate.childNode(withName: topBorder).size.height
* (Maybe) Separate background and ground. Ground becomes obstacle. Results in more physics, but might help with different screen sizes (guessing!), and better U
