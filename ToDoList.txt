UIs
* Traveller
    -   Fish needs some animation for swimming, 2D swimming
    -   Or just redraw it so it looks 2.5D all the time
* Obstacle
    -   Trim instead of resize. Or position differently so its always full size, but can go off screen
* Own background
* Main menu prettyness
    ** Background
    ** Buttons
    ** Font, logos
    ** Button press animations
* Count down animation
* How to play animation on the main menu
* Pause button logo
* Countdown going big to small, like THREEeee, TWWOOoo, OOOOnnee...
* Move buttons to sensible places to prevent accidental touch
* Some bubbles from the fish maybe?
* Make obstacle, traveller, labels, dependent on screen size instead of fixed

Gameplay
* When pause is pressed, a big play button appears on screen
* Move high score to some parent or handler struct so game menu can access it
* Traveller impulse dependent on screen height? But then might want max gap dependent also
* Pause button needs to be hidden when game ends. Not working currently


Test
* Test sizes, renders, methods, collisions

UI Requiring Gameplay changes
* Border at the top for buttons? All tube y positions will have to change by border height.. like deletgate.childNode(withName: topBorder).size.height
* (Maybe) Separate background and ground. Ground becomes obstacle. Results in more physics, but might help with different screen sizes (guessing!), and better U

Performance
* Countdown is only needed for first 3 seconds, but the timer runs indefinitely. Need to disable this.
* Ideally also find a way to also be able to run a countdown after pausing
