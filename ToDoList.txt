UI - Features
* Count down animation
* How to play animation or instruction on the main menu
* Countdown going big to small, like THREEeee, TWWOOoo, OOOOnnee...
* Some bubbles from the fish
* Countdown different font

Gameplay
* When pause is pressed, a big play button appears on screen to unpause it
* When play is pressed after a pause, game remains paused for 3 seconds, with a countdown
* Traveller impulse dependent on screen height? But then might want max gap dependent also
* Max score of 999 which when reached, game stops, and a message is displayed

Test
* Test sizes, renders, methods, collisions

UI Requiring Gameplay changes
* (Maybe) Separate background and ground. Ground becomes obstacle. Results in more physics, but might help with different screen sizes (guessing!), and better U

Performance
* Countdown is only needed for first 3 seconds, but the timer runs indefinitely. Need to disable this.
* Ideally also find a way to also be able to run a countdown after pausing
